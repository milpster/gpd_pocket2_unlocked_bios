Things that work with this on the pocket 2 256gb SSD celeron 3965Y:
  - disabling ME
  - disabling TDP throttling, current throttling
  - altering thermal controls
  - acpi config stuff
  - one user preset to store your things beyond a bios reset
  - messing with some memory settings such as training algorithms
Things that dont seem to work but are accessible:
  - Overclocking of any kind (ring, gt, cpu)
  - memory settings including timings and voltages


Bios can be reset by opening up the pocket 2 and removing the battery for a while.

Other than that, in most cases it will detect a hang itself and undo the last change and reboot.
